# photon-thermistor
A thermistor library for Particle Photon based on Adafruit's thermistor example 
at https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor with thermistor 
hardware http://www.adafruit.com/products/372.

Most other thermistor libraries assume the maximum analogRead value is 1023, but
the Photon's maximum analogRead value is 4095!

This library uses the simplified version of the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation described by
Adafruit with full configuration of the required variables as constructor parameters.

For NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistors only!

### Hookup

![Breadboard Hookup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kegnet/photon-thermistor/master/breadboard_hookup.png)

Or see https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor

### Configuration

Configuration is done via constructor parameters:

```
Thermistor(int pin, int seriesResistor, int adcMax, int thermistorNominal, int temperatureNominal, int bCoef, int samples, int sampleDelay);

<pin>: Photon pin
<seriesResistor>: The resistance value of the fixed resistor (based on your hardware setup)
<adcMax>: The maximum analog-to-digital convert value returned by analogRead (Photon is 4095 NOT the typical Arduino 1023!)
<thermistorNominal>: Resistance at nominal temperature (will be documented with the thermistor, usually "10k")
<temperatureNominal>: Temperature for nominal resistance in celcius (will be supplied with the thermistor, assume 25 if not stated)
<bCoef>: Beta coefficient of the thermistor; usually 3435 or 3950 (will be documented with the thermistor)
<samples>: Number of analog samples to average (for smoothing)
<sampleDelay>: Milliseconds between analog samples (for smoothing)
```

### Example

```
#include "photon-thermistor.h"

Thermistor *thermistor;

void setup() {
  thermistor = new Thermistor(A1, 10000, 4095, 10000, 25, 3950, 5, 20);
}

void loop() {
  float tempF = thermistor->readTempF();
  Particle.publish(String("temp"), String(tempF));
  delay(5000);
}
```
